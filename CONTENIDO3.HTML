    <td><p>Wehrmacht is the German word for Defense Force,
        from "wehren" (to defend) and "Macht" (strength).  
         Therefore, in German, the term applies to any 
         country and not only to the German armed forces,
          although the term has been widely used in
           publications in other languages to refer 
           to the German armed forces of the period
            1935-1945. Thus, in German, for example, 
           "italienische wehrmacht" means the Italian
           Fierce Armed Forces.   After World War II 
           the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of
           Germany are called Bundeswehr, literally 
           "Federal Defense".

        At the end of the First World War, on November 11, 
        1919, the German armed forces were called "Friedensheer"
         or Peace Force and after the institution of the Weimar
          Republic, on March 6, 1919, a decree was issued
           creating the "Vorläufige Reichswehr" or Provisional
            Defense Force of the Reich which was formed
             with just over 400,000 troops.  However,
              the Treaty of Versailles of May 1919, 
              limited the power of the Vorläufige Reichswehr 
              to a maximum of 100,000 troops, of which only 4,000 
              could be officers, without the existence of a General
               Staff and the prohibition of military conscription.
    <br>
    <br>
    Between 1933 and the end of 1936 the Deutsches Wehrmacht 
    went from 100,000 to 550,000 men in arms, and by 1939 
    the number of all weapons amounted to 2,750,000 men. 
      When the restructuring of the Heeres (Army) began in 1935,
       it became a fast moving mobile machine equipped with 
       modern rolling stock intercommunicated by radio and 
       supported by the Luftwaffe.

            Deutsches Wehrmacht
            <br>
            <br>
            In 1933, immediately after National Socialism took 
            power and after Adolf Hitler was recognized as the new Chancellor,
             the Treaty of Versailles was denounced.  
              The military immediately supported the resolution signed 
              by Hitler with his new foreign policy, which evidently 
              aimed at revising the structure of the Reichswehr.
            <br>
            <br>
            To accelerate the process of modernization and expansion
             of the armed forces, the Reichwehr was replaced by 
             the new Wehrmacht, unified armed forces that included
              the Heeres (Army), the Kriegsmarine (Navy) and the Luftwaffe (Air Force).
            <br>
            <br>
            The Kriegsmarine was also modernized starting with the
             launch of the battleship Scharnhorst in 1936, followed 
             by the Gneisenaau in 1938 and a year later with the 
             Bismarck and Tirpitz, in accordance with Plan Z, which 
             was never completed.  In 1939 the Kriegsmarine had 50,000 troops,
              three battleships, two heavy cruisers and six light cruisers,
               22 destroyers, 16 torpedo boats and 57 submarines, an insufficient
                force to face the Royal Navy, so the construction of submarines
                 increased extraordinarily.   On March 1st 1935, the Luftwaffe 
                 joined the Wehrmacht as the third weapon with 400,000 men and 
                 more than 4,000 planes of the latest design.  
                 It was in its time a fearsome force with unparalleled air superiority.
            <br>
            <br>
            In 1939, wrongly and against the opinion of his generals,
             Hitler considered the Wehrmacht ready to support his plans
              to recover the territories lost by the Treaty of Versailles
               and before Poland took the initiative, which was seen coming,
                he began the offensive that in five weeks destroyed the 
                largest army in Europe, although poorly equipped and trained with World War I tactics.
