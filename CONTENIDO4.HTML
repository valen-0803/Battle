    <td><p>Operation Blue was executed by 
        the German Wehrmacht in 1942. The
         objective of this operation was to 
         take away the oil wells of the 
         Caucasus from the Soviet Union.

        <b>Background</b>
         <br>
        On June 22, 1941, the German armies invaded 
        the Soviet Union. The ability of the U.S.S.R.
         to create new divisions and the arrival of 
         cold winter were reasons for the German defeat
          in the Battle of Moscow. Hitler began planning
           an offensive in southern Russia with the objetive
            of capturing the Caucasus, which was the one 
            that provided oil to the Soviet Union.

    <p > <b> OBJECTIVES OF THE HITLER PLAN</b>
        <br>
        To carry out Hitler's plan, the German armies would have
         had to have double strength, triple mobility and quadruple aviation. 
         The troops had had to rest and be completed.
        <br>
        <br>
        They had fought relentlessly since the beginning of the war with the USSR,
         and the losses they had suffered had not been made up for in personnel or materiel.
          The companies rarely numbered more than 60 men, the Panzer divisions, 80 tanks.
        <br>
        <br>
        On September 9, Hitler takes direct command of Group A and completely 
        loses interest in the Caucasus, focusing his gaze on Stalingrad. 
        Meanwhile, 20 divisions of the Axis forces fought for every meter 
        advancing into Stalingrad, and the Luftwaffe bombardments of the
         city only created more chaos which the Soviet defenders used to better hide.

        <b>FAILURE OF THE BLUE OPERATION</b> 
    <br>
    Hitler's obsession with taking Stalingrad caused 
    him to lose sight of the initial objective of Operation Blue:
     the capture of the oil wells of the Caucasus.
