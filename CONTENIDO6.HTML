        In Stalingrad there is violent fighting between Russians and Germans; 
        the troops of the 6th Army are decimated, exhausted, suffering from 
        the cold and diseases. The lack of food has led the besieged to eat 
        about 12,000 horses. Seven Soviet armies, under the command of Zhukov, 
        are closing in on Stalingrad and pressing inland to annihilate the
         defenders; because of their precarious air supply, from tomorrow 
         their daily ration of bread will drop from 200 to 100 grams. 
         Paulus, disgusted at the absurdity of Hitler's orders, realized that,
          for the F端hrer, the 6th Army, or what was left of it, was little 
          less than a sacrificial piece in the game of war. The lives of the
           soldiers were not of the least importance to Hitler. Because while
            Nazi hierarchs like Erich Koch, the Gauleiter or governor of
             the occupied territories of Ukraine, chartered a Luftwaffe plane 
             to Rostov to bring him 200 pounds of caviar, while soldiers 
             starved or died of starvation in Stalingrad. Nazi hierarchs 
             will ask for his cessation; but the Reich is infested with these
              corrupt politicians. The F端hrer defends them by their bloodthirsty
               and efficient capacity to exploit resources and necessary labor for the war.
                The civilians of the occupied territories hate them.59 By December 25th,
                 in the Kessel, 1280 soldiers die of cold and hunger. For the new year,
                  the Soviets set up a series of kitchens and held parties on the south 
                  bank of the Volga with the double aim of celebrating the year and
                   demoralizing the encircled Germans.

      <p>At the end of the month, the 4th Romanian Army was annihilated
           during the counteroffensive of the Red Army towards Kotielnovski
            by Malinovsky's 2nd Army of Guards, what is left of the 4th 
            Panzerarmee is retreating to 200-240 km from Stalingrad.
             Operation Winter Storm was rejected. The Russian forces 
             of the Stalingrad Front arrive at the Verkhne-Rubezhni-Tormosin-Gluboki line,
              having the possibility of launching a big offensive on the southern sector 
              of the German front.

        At 6:05 a.m. on January 10, the high command of the Stalingrad
         Front gives the order to attack the German positions in Stalingrad. 
         Operation Koltso or Ring began with the firing of some 7,000 Katyuska guns,
          mortars and rocket launchers that for 55 minutes beat the German trenches.
           Then, waves of infants supported by tanks are launched. 
           The offensive is centered on taking the Pitomnik airfield,
            where the Ju 52 land, bringing supplies to the besieged and 
            carrying away their wounded. That day, the F端hrer radiates to Von Paulus 
            "I forbid the capitulation. The troops must defend their positions to the 
            last man and the last cartridge, so that with their heroic behavior they 
            can contribute to the stabilization of the front and the defense of the West.

        By February 2, the 51st Army Corps, under the command of General Streker or Schrenck, 
        will surrender. With this action the combat for the devastated city ends, 
        the biggest battle of the Second World War. From January 10 until today,
         the Red Army has eliminated 22 divisions of the Werhmacht,
          and another 160 units sent to help the 6th Army. Some 11,000 German soldiers
           did not surrender and continued to fight until the end; 
           at the beginning of March the Soviets destroyed the last pockets
            of resistance in the basements and tunnels.
